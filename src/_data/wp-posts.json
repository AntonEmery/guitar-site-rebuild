      "rendered": "<p>I have been doing more mic testing and trying to find the optimal recording setup for my studio room. I think if I just rented space at a local studio I would have another album out by now&#8230;  But I enjoy the process of learning to do it myself, and being able to record and edit without having to worry about how much money I am spending will be good. I could not afford the nice Gefells or 184&#8217;s I was borrowing, so my goal now is to find a suitable quiet clean mic that costs less.</p>\n<p>I have been borrowing a pair of Audio Technica 2020 mics from my friend. I was encouraged to check them out after Doug Young posted some nice sounding sample clips on a Zoom H6, which is the same recorder I have. He was also in his untreated spare bedroom, and not a professional studio room.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"AT2020 - Zoom H6 demo by Doug Young\" width=\"1184\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F64969519&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1184&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>At the same time I was also able to borrow a pair of Audio Technica 3035&#8217;s from a local store, Portland Super Digital. They will let you borrow mics and a hold a credit card number, which is great. I find the best way to evaluate a mic is in my room on my gear.</p>\n<p>Both the 2020 and 3035 are technically medium diaphram condensors. The 3035 is a discontinued model that was made in Japan, and has been replaced by the 2035. The 2020 has a built in low end roll off starting at what looks like 220 hz and a self noise of 19db. The 3035 has a low cut and pad switch and a rated self noise of 11db. I was happy with my initial recordings with the 2020, but could hear a bit of noise from the mic. I was mostly curious if the lower noise rating of the 3035 would make a difference. Both mics are affordable, so if the 3035 was better I was inclined to go with that.

      "rendered": "<p>For the past week I was fortunate to be able to borrow two pairs of nice mics from a friend. They are Neumann KM 184&#8217;s and Gefell 300M&#8217;s. Both are small diaphram condensers and go for about $1800-$2000 a pair. I have never been able to use mics of this caliber for an extended period of time in my own room on my own gear. I thnk whenever evaluating a mic if possible it is best to use it in your own space on your own gear. Only then will you really know it works for you. This whole thing started when I posted a question on the Acoustic Guitar Forum on getting a better recorded sound at home. You can check out the ten page thread <a href=\"http://www.acousticguitarforum.com/forums/showthread.php?t=359738\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is my basic setup position, pictured here with my ADK A6&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/antonemery.com/images/setup.jpg?resize=600%2C450\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The mics are 24&#8243; apart, and about 20&#8243; away. The capsules are 36&#8243; from the ground. I am using a Gitano guitar support that you can see in the picture. All mics are going straight into my Zoom H6 digital recorder, no additional preamps or anything. I dumped the tracks into a Logic X afterwards to trim off the ends, but otherwise did no other editing or processing.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to thank my friend <a href=\"http://www.dougyoungguitar.com\" target=\"_blank\">Doug Young</a> for the endless back and forth emails helping me with mic placement and giving his opinion.

I think maybe it was because the nail was alot thicker due to the acrylic compound. Who knows, Martin Simpson uses acrylics and sounds great on banjo. I also didn&#8217;t really like the sound of the nails on the wound strings of my guitar. After I took the acrylics off my nails were pretty useless for a few months as they were very weak and thin.

              "rendered": "<p>A few words about the pros and cons of acrylic nails:</p>\n<p>I was at one time a great aficionado of acrylic nails. I bought the silk fabric, acrylic powder, solvent, and brushes, and meticulously made my own multi-layered nails. I ignored a warning by another guitarist that eventually my body would reject the acrylic. This did happen after a year or so. It was probably exacerbated by my having hypersensitive skin and psoriasis. In a very short time, my nail beds became quite badly inflamed. I had to remove and stop using acrylic, and my nails were  permanently damaged.</p>\n<p>Although the acrylics seemed to increase my playing speed (and, of course, my overall volume), I&#8217;ve found that with a good guitar (1991 Santa Cruz OM) and little or no fingernail, I can get great dynamics and plenty of note articulation. I&#8217;d love to have healthy fingernails again, but I don&#8217;t feel particularly impeded by the lack of them.</p>\n"

I probably should have measured..</p>\n<p>My very uneducated guess is that the noise that was being picked up by the mics now has to pass thru the panels setup behind them in a V. This causes the sound to be converted to heat, and not being picked up by the mics.</p>\n<p>If it is possible you could move the computer completely out of the room and use longer cables. I have an iMac, and with everything being built into the monitor do not have that option. Another if you are technically inclined is to replace the fans in your PC with quieter ones, or better yet, a water cooling system, which is totally silent. Stock PC&#8217;s are usually quite loud.</p>\n<p>Let me know if i can help further.</p>\n"

I stumbled upon it and you while searching for an open tuning (cgcgcf) that I am pursuing. So, am now strung up in Orkney and feeling the over and undertow&#8217;s (tones) of this incredible wonder. Enjoyed the snow flake joke about the paddy melt. Snicker, snicker&#8230;got all the Orkney chords down on yellow paper. Enjoy Steve. May your sustain last as long as you can bare it&#8230;fellow string plucker and Celt about 1500 years misplaced. Always, Bruce.</p>\n"

The X in the tab indicates a normal downward frail, but its not sounding a melody note. Its more like a muted note/percussive effect. My banjo is made by Brooks Masten, who lives here in Portland. </p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any more questions.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

I play by ear but wonder what the x means in your tab and also what banjo you&#8217;re using.  I&#8217;ve played guitars in a variant of Orkney tuning with a drone string.  Hope to hear more of your stuff on banjo.  (Don&#8217;t quite know where this is getting posted but trust it&#8217;s on your own site).</p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Hi Alan. I think ideally the player should determine the sound of the music, and not be overly influenced by patterns dictated by a particular tuning. That being said tunings like DADGAD and Drop D work well due to the prevalence of D notes in celtic music and pleasing sound of open strings ringing. So if I have a tune in D I have the 6th and 4th strings that can ring open while I play a melody on the higher strings. If I am playing in G I could base my root around the 6th string 5th fret, and also still have the open 3rd string to use. If playing in a key like Em or Bm you might use a capo or choose to finger that tune totally differently and not have as many open strings. I know Pierre Bensusan came to distrust the &#8220;prepackaged beauty&#8221; of DADGAD. </p>\n<p>To me it is more for an ease of playing. Certain tunings allow me to easier grab bass notes while keeping a melody going.</p>\n"

      "rendered": "<p>I have been doing more experimenting with my home recording setup, working on ironing out the little details and striving to get a better sound. My main setup has been:</p>\n<p><strong>Pair of ADK A6 mics</strong><br />\n<strong> Presonus Studio Mobile Interface</strong><br />\n<strong> iMac and Logic Pro</strong></p>\n<p>All affordable gear but I think it gives good bang for the buck. My main goal is to get a good a sound as I can with the gear i can afford.  I would like to do basic recording and editing at home, then ship it off to someone else for mixing and mastering. Below is the configuration I have settled on for the present, the ADK mics in a spaced pair, about 19 inches from the guitar. Sorry about the faint car noise at the end.</p>\n\n<p>I first heard the ADK A6 mics at Dreamguitars.com  Al Petteway used them to record all the guitar samples, and I thought they sounded good. Corresponding with him I found out they just plugged them straight into a digital recorder in a quiet room. Sometime later Dreamguitars happened to be selling their pair of A6&#8217;s, so I picked them up. They seem well built, are quiet, and sensitive enough for fingerstyle guitar. They do seem to get the best sound farther out from the source.</p>\n<p>In my limited experience one of the biggest problems recording at home are room acoustics and room noise. Computer fans, traffic outside, neighbors, spouses, and the furnace/fridge/other appliances all get picked up by the mics. I have avoided some outside noise by recording late at night, and thankfully I am far enough away from any major appliances. But I live on a bus line and some sound does get in through the windows. In addition the mics pick up a bit of fan and hard drive noise from my iMac. The ideal solution would be to put the computer on the other side of the wall but since everything is build into the monitor that is not really an option. My other thought is to get a used Mac mini for recording or in a future recording space be able to get far enough away from the iMac.</p>\n<p><strong>Mic Configurations</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>I have experimented with a variety of mic placements but keep coming back to spaced pair.  One mic is pointed at the 12th fret and the other at the lower bout, making sure to avoid the sound hole. The mics seem to pick up less room noise in this configuration and its easier for me to get a good balanced stereo image. I wish I could mic closer to avoid more room noise, but ADK seem to have a fairly strong proximity effect.</p>\n<p>If you are thinking about getting these mics hopefully this post gave you a little more information. There are a ton of choices in this price range, and I think the ADK&#8217;s are worth checking out, especially if you can pick up a pair used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Below is the configuration I have settled on for the present, the ADK mics in a spaced pair, about 19 inches from the guitar. Sorry about the faint car noise at the end.\r\n\r\n[audio http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/audio/adk_spacedpair.wav]\r\n\r\nI first heard the ADK A6 mics at Dreamguitars.com  Al Petteway used them to record all the guitar samples, and I thought they sounded good. Corresponding with him I found out they just plugged them straight into a digital recorder in a quiet room. Sometime later Dreamguitars happened to be selling their pair of A6's, so I picked them up. They seem well built, are quiet, and sensitive enough for fingerstyle guitar. They do seem to get the best sound farther out from the source.\r\n\r\nIn my limited experience one of the biggest problems recording at home are room acoustics and room noise. Computer fans, traffic outside, neighbors, spouses, and the furnace/fridge/other appliances all get picked up by the mics. I have avoided some outside noise by recording late at night, and thankfully I am far enough away from any major appliances. But I live on a bus line and some sound does get in through the windows. In addition the mics pick up a bit of fan and hard drive noise from my iMac. The ideal solution would be to put the computer on the other side of the wall but since everything is build into the monitor that is not really an option. My other thought is to get a used Mac mini for recording or in a future recording space be able to get far enough away from the iMac.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mic Configurations</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong></strong>I have experimented with a variety of mic placements but keep coming back to spaced pair.  One mic is pointed at the 12th fret and the other at the lower bout, making sure to avoid the sound hole. The mics seem to pick up less room noise in this configuration and its easier for me to get a good balanced stereo image. I wish I could mic closer to avoid more room noise, but ADK seem to have a fairly strong proximity effect.\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking about getting these mics hopefully this post gave you a little more information. There are a ton of choices in this price range, and I think the ADK's are worth checking out, especially if you can pick up a pair used.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Gilbert and Mir are cooling off from the hike.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8313/8030767537_2401194d13_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" />\r\n\r\nPhoto by Windie Chow"

      "rendered": "<p>I have been spending some time lately on other musical activities and wanted to write about them a bit here. While arranging celtic music for solo guitar will always be my main thing, it is a relatively lonely pursuit and I enjoy playing music with others too. There is just a bigger energy and sound that comes with three or four people playing together. I recently started playing in a band with three other folks. I am on guitar/flute/banjo, and we also have a mandolin player, accordian, and percussion, courtesy of <a href=\"http://folkdrummer.tumblr.com/\">Vash</a>.  We have just had a few practices so far but are coming up with some good material, which looks to be a mixture of irish music, folk, and bluegrass. Our initial goal is to gig in the Portland area, and look for some photos and audio samples here in the coming months.</p>\n<p>The other thing I have been trying to do more of is music composition. In particular multi tracking in my home studio. I have a modest but effective setup that includes Logic Pro, a Presonus Mobile interface, and Line Audio and ADK mics. I record in our office but the room has a bit of acoustic treatment and I can get a half decent sound, provided the bus is not going by or the folks across the street are not installing a roof. How I wish for a sound proof room..</p>\n<p>I have always been interested in composing but once the celtic music bug bit that kind of took precedence. In the recent years I have been wanting to get back to creating some original music and am finally dedicating some time to it. With so much new media these days in the form of video games, mobile applications, and web content there seem to be more opportunities to have your music licensed and possibly make a bit of money. I am sure the competition is still fierce but at least there are more options than just moving to LA and trying to become a hollywood composer. As with alot of things I think networking and who you know is key. Being able to compose good music has to be a given. There are a number of services that will shop your music to potential clients. My solo cd is represented by a local Portland company Marmoset Music.</p>\n<p>While they sound awesome I do not have the background to compose Hans Zimmer-esque orchestral battle scenes, so that is not really what I am shooting for.  I am more inspired to compose with the instruments I can already play (guitar, banjo, flute, mando) augmented with some MIDI sounds.  I have been listening alot to <a href=\"http://www.davidhamburgermusic.com\">David Hamburger</a> lately, a blues/jazz musician who made the transition into scoring.  He plays most of the fretted instrument family, combining them with percussion and strings on occasion. His stuff is mostly rooted in the blues/jazz/americana camp, which is something I could see myself doing. Ill need to get a Fender Telecaster first though.</p>\n<p>I am also a bit of a video game fan and have been inspired lately by game music. <a href=\"http://www.dbsoundworks.com\">Danny Baranowsky</a> has composed some beautiful music for games such as the <a href=\"http://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/the-binding-of-isaac-2\">Binding of Issac</a> and <a href=\"http://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/super-meat-boy-digital-special-edition-soundtrack\">Super Meat Boy</a>. Darren Korb combined acoustic instruments with beats and samples for the game <a href=\"http://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/\">Bastion</a> in a style he describes as &#8220;acoustic frontier trip hop&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So I will be posting here from time to time about my compositional activities and will probably put up some musical samples as well. I know its a bit of a stretch from celtic guitar and traditional music, but to me its all music so its all good.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

While arranging celtic music for solo guitar will always be my main thing, it is a relatively lonely pursuit and I enjoy playing music with others too. There is just a bigger energy and sound that comes with three or four people playing together. I recently started playing in a band with three other folks. I am on guitar/flute/banjo, and we also have a mandolin player, accordian, and percussion, courtesy of <a href=\"http://folkdrummer.tumblr.com/\">Vash</a>.  We have just had a few practices so far but are coming up with some good material, which looks to be a mixture of irish music, folk, and bluegrass. Our initial goal is to gig in the Portland area, and look for some photos and audio samples here in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I have been trying to do more of is music composition. In particular multi tracking in my home studio. I have a modest but effective setup that includes Logic Pro, a Presonus Mobile interface, and Line Audio and ADK mics. I record in our office but the room has a bit of acoustic treatment and I can get a half decent sound, provided the bus is not going by or the folks across the street are not installing a roof. How I wish for a sound proof room..\r\n\r\nI have always been interested in composing but once the celtic music bug bit that kind of took precedence. In the recent years I have been wanting to get back to creating some original music and am finally dedicating some time to it. With so much new media these days in the form of video games, mobile applications, and web content there seem to be more opportunities to have your music licensed and possibly make a bit of money. I am sure the competition is still fierce but at least there are more options than just moving to LA and trying to become a hollywood composer. As with alot of things I think networking and who you know is key. Being able to compose good music has to be a given. There are a number of services that will shop your music to potential clients. My solo cd is represented by a local Portland company Marmoset Music.\r\n\r\nWhile they sound awesome I do not have the background to compose Hans Zimmer-esque orchestral battle scenes, so that is not really what I am shooting for.  I am more inspired to compose with the instruments I can already play (guitar, banjo, flute, mando) augmented with some MIDI sounds.  I have been listening alot to <a href=\"http://www.davidhamburgermusic.com\">David Hamburger</a> lately, a blues/jazz musician who made the transition into scoring.  He plays most of the fretted instrument family, combining them with percussion and strings on occasion. His stuff is mostly rooted in the blues/jazz/americana camp, which is something I could see myself doing. Ill need to get a Fender Telecaster first though.\r\n\r\nI am also a bit of a video game fan and have been inspired lately by game music. <a href=\"http://www.dbsoundworks.com\">Danny Baranowsky</a> has composed some beautiful music for games such as the <a href=\"http://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/the-binding-of-isaac-2\">Binding of Issac</a> and <a href=\"http://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/super-meat-boy-digital-special-edition-soundtrack\">Super Meat Boy</a>. Darren Korb combined acoustic instruments with beats and samples for the game <a href=\"http://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/\">Bastion</a> in a style he describes as \"acoustic frontier trip hop\".\r\n\r\nSo I will be posting here from time to time about my compositional activities and will probably put up some musical samples as well. I know its a bit of a stretch from celtic guitar and traditional music, but to me its all music so its all good.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

We looked at different ways to play behind songs, and John switched around from Drop D, DADGAD, and CFCGCD tunings demonstrating different approaches and tonalities. He seemed to very quickly map out the tuning and be able to utilize its unique sound in the context of the song. I guess that is why he is one of the best.</p>\n<p>At the moment I am interested in CFCGCD more for flatpicking and rhythmic backup. I have been putting a capo at the second fret, which brings the tuning to DGDADE. That gives us three open D strings, which is good for celtic music, since D is such a common tonality. If you look at the fifth, fourth, third, and first strings you have the notes GDAE, which is the same as the mandolin. This allows a few different keys to lay logically in first position. The second string can cause some tricky string crossing with the picking hand, but its nothing that can&#8217;t be overcome with a bit of practice.</p>\n<p>I have not figured out many chords in this tuning yet, just a few movable shapes that allow one to play modal chords. When backing up celtic tunes i tend to avoid chords with lots of thirds, preferring roots, fifths, and octaves.</p>\n<p>My flatpicking is still a work in progress but here is a tune I have been enjoying lately, John Henry&#8217;s Favorite. It is a nice simple reel in D which I first heard from the flute player John Creaven. Check out the yotube video below, and you can download the TAB if you want to learn to play the tune.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/DFNfXx58E-w\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/johnfav.mp3\">Download MP3</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/JohnHenryFav.pdf\">Download TAB</a></p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy it, and in the future I will post some more tunes in this fun new tuning.

That gives you DGDADE. I love using the Orkney tuning, which is CGDGCD, for my fingerstyle arrangements as most of you probably know. I have worked out a good system for backup in that tuning as well with a capo at the second fret, giving me the notes DAEADE. I like the chords and that face that I can get alot of Root-octave-unison voicings. My ear tends to gravitate towards that sound when backing celtic tunes. But Orkney is not great for flatpicking with a capo at the second fret. The lack of an open D note on the 4th string makes alot of melody playing more difficult than I would like. D is such a pivotal note in celtic music. I could just retune to Drop D, which I have done some in the past and when I play in my duo with Rich. But I have never been happy with my backup in Drop D, and the chords are alot of work for the left hand. I probably just don&#8217;t do it enough.</p>\n<p>Anyways, messing around with this CFCGCD tuning has been alot of fun. The app I use to generate the chord charts does not work so well when you want to indicate a capo. So I would recommend putting a capo on the second fret and trying these same chord shapes. Just transpose the chord names up a whole step. G becomes A, C becomes D, etc.</p>\n<p>Coming up, I will post some tunes I have been flatpicking i this tuning, along with notation and video. If you look at the 5th, 4th, 3rd, and 1st strings you have the notes GDAE, which is just like the fiddle. So alot of melody lays really nicely on the fingerboard.</p>\n",

They were created using a piece of software called Fretty Charts, which was put together by guitarist Simon Fox. I think he has since taken it down, but this software filled the simple need of quickly being able generate chord graphics and charts. Programs like Finale and Sibelius are great, but if you want to slap a bunch of chord symbols on a 8.5 x 11 PDF file they can be overly complicated. It would be great to see Simon bring this software back. </p>\n<p>I recently came across a fairly convenient way to output chord charts on my iPhone. The Guitar Toolkit app plus add on allows you to generate chords, place them on a chord sheet, and print or email the file. Not bad for being totally self contained on the iPhone. The software isnt perfect, if you notate chords with a capo on the capo shows up as a fretted string on the chord diagram, which is a bit problematic. But other than that it works well, and its very convenient to able to notate chords when I have a few minutes and email them to students. </p>\n<p>The Orkney chord chart below is for a guitar with no capo. Whenever I backup irish music I almost always have a capo at the second fret. So try that as well and move the chords up a whole step. C becomes D, G becomes A, etc. I have tried other tunings for backup and I just keep coming back to Orkney. Perhaps I am just used to it. Other people certainly sound great in Drop D or DADGAD. The one downside is Orkney is not great for flatpicking, not having a D on that open fourth string is awkward. But I do not really flatpick a ton of irish tunes, so its not a big deal. If I need to I just go to Drop D, though i would like to explore the CFCGCD tuning more that John Doyle uses. Its not a far leap from Orkney, and with a capo at II makes it DGDADE, which is much better for flatpicking. I guess in the end its hard for me to settle on one tuning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/OrkneyGuitarChords.pdf\">Download Orkney Chord Chart PDF</a> </p>\n",

He does this using a flatpick and his middle finger, and gets a sound that is closer to fingerpicking. Its cool because he go from a fingestyle kind of accompaniment to flatpicking lead lines to faster rhythmic strumming in the space of the same tune. He went over the hybrid picking technique in the class I took, but it was hard to really grasp it just by watching him. Being able to work on some of these notated examples will be handy.</p>\n",

Its made by <a href=\"http://www.brooksbanjos.com\">Brooks Masten</a>, has an 11&#8243; cherry rim, fiberskin head, walnut neck, ebony fingerboard, and brass tone ring. Its basically a stock Spartan model except for his custom tailpiece. Brooks was great to work with and lives about fifteen minutes from me here in Portland. Thanks to him for allowing me to use his photos.</p>\n\n<p>I had an old Lyon and Healy banjo from the early 1900&#8217;s but just ended up being not that thrilled with it. My new banjo stays in tune better (for a banjo), and the neck is just alot more comfortable. The neck and string spacing are also wider, which is beneficial for clawhammer. I know alot of folks like older banjos, which is cool. They can have a neat vibe, are often cheaper, and can sound good. For me in this case I just preferred a modern instrument.</p>\n<p>I have been playing clawhammer banjo for a few years, it was kind of a natural progression from doing clawhammer style things on guitar. I am attracted to instruments that are fun to play in a solo context, where melody, rhythm, and other voices are all self contained. Playing clawhammer banjo this way is so much fun. Its very relaxing to sit on the couch and frail away. Of course playing in a group is fun, and the duo of clawhammer banjo and fiddle is especially nice.</p>\n<p>I know some of the standard old time repotiore but am more interested in the banjo as a vehicle for arranging non typical tunes. I play a set of Breton tunes that work quite well on banjo, and some irish reels are nice too, though I would play them in a standard session.</p>\n<p>Ill try to post a few videos of these arrangements sometime soon.</p>\n",

Its made by <a href=\"http://www.brooksbanjos.com\">Brooks Masten</a>, has an 11\" cherry rim, fiberskin head, walnut neck, ebony fingerboard, and brass tone ring. Its basically a stock Spartan model except for his custom tailpiece. Brooks was great to work with and lives about fifteen minutes from me here in Portland. Thanks to him for allowing me to use his photos.\r\n\r\n[gallery link=\"file\"]\r\n\r\nI had an old Lyon and Healy banjo from the early 1900's but just ended up being not that thrilled with it. My new banjo stays in tune better (for a banjo), and the neck is just alot more comfortable. The neck and string spacing are also wider, which is beneficial for clawhammer. I know alot of folks like older banjos, which is cool. They can have a neat vibe, are often cheaper, and can sound good. For me in this case I just preferred a modern instrument.\r\n\r\nI have been playing clawhammer banjo for a few years, it was kind of a natural progression from doing clawhammer style things on guitar. I am attracted to instruments that are fun to play in a solo context, where melody, rhythm, and other voices are all self contained. Playing clawhammer banjo this way is so much fun. Its very relaxing to sit on the couch and frail away. Of course playing in a group is fun, and the duo of clawhammer banjo and fiddle is especially nice.\r\n\r\nI know some of the standard old time repotiore but am more interested in the banjo as a vehicle for arranging non typical tunes. I play a set of Breton tunes that work quite well on banjo, and some irish reels are nice too, though I would play them in a standard session.\r\n\r\nIll try to post a few videos of these arrangements sometime soon.",

      "rendered": "<p>There is a bit of discussion going on at the <a href=\"http://www.tradconnect.com\">TradConnect</a> forum on guitar backup, and someone asked for guitar chords in Drop D. I thought I would post some here so everyone can benefit.<br />\nDespite this being &#8220;celtic fingerstyle guitar&#8221; I also like to flatpick a bit, both backing up tunes and playing melodies. Orkney tuning is nice for backup but to me not so great for flatpicking. The lack of an open D note on the 4th string makes various passages in tunes difficult. D is a pivotal note in celtic music. The way the notes are laid out in Drop D or standard tuning makes flatpicking melodies easier. I guess what it comes down to is I will never be able to settle on one tuning.</p>\n<p>Like many folks I was first attracted to Drop D for celtic backup listening to <a href=\"http://www.johndoylemusic.com\">John Doyle&#8217;s</a> playing. Thought its fairly old now his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Rhythm-Guitar-Accompanying-Celtic/dp/B0002Y4TSS\">DVD</a> on Homespun offers good insight into his chord shapes and right hand rhythms. I think Drop D gives a nice chunky sound with the opportunity for full chord voicings from the sixth string to the first string. Like John I use a thinner pick, a Dunlop Nylon .73mm. Its thick enough for flatpicking celtic tunes, but thin enough for the fast strumming and playing triplets.</p>\n<p>Below are a handful of the basic chords I use in drop D. Alot of them I got from Doyle&#8217;s playing and the list is by no means complete. For those that are interested I created the images in the Guitar Toolkit app on my iPhone. Then I took a screenshot and transferred the images over to my computer. Pretty neat.

Your basic empty bedroom is just not well suited to recording. I don&#8217;t know a ton about the science behind it, but I think it involves parallel walls causing sound waves to collide and amplify certain frequencies.

In a nutshell its using clawhammer banjo technique but on a guitar. If you can play clawhammer banjo you can probably pick up a guitar and do it with a bit of adjustment. I found it much easier to learn the technique on banjo first.  When I first saw Steve doing this six or seven years ago it was more of a right hand fingerpicking pattern that had the same rhythm as clawhammer banjo, with the thumb playing on the &#8220;and&#8221; of two. Over time it evolved into standard clawhammer technique. </p>\n<p>Playing claw guitar is a bit different then on the banjo. For one you have more strings so there are some different options as far as tunings and drone strings. I think the guitar having more sustain lets you play tunes that might not work as well on the banjo. Check out my arrangement of <a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/2010/lord-mayo-clawhammer-guitar/\">Lord Mayo</a> to see what I mean. </p>\n<p>Having a heavy bass string as a drone string can also be problematic sometimes. I feel I have to be bit more sensitive of how I play the drone string on a guitar or things tend to sound overwhelmed by the bass. Alot of times I will clawhammer in Double Drop D, which is DADGBD. That way I can switch between the 6th and the 4th strings as drone strings. CGDGCD or the Orkney tuning is also nice for clawhammer as its not to far from sawmill banjo tuning of gDGCD. One fun thing to do on guitar is what Steve calls a &#8220;High Five&#8221; or &#8220;High Six&#8221; tuning. What you do is swap out your fifth or sixth string with a high string of the same pitch. So with Orkney I would remove the sixth string and put on an .16 guage second string tuned up to G. This would give me gGDGCD. It can be problematic tuning a string up that high so what you will need to do is get something like a Third Hand Capo or a sixth string capo that can target individual strings. I tuned the 6th string to B initially and then capoed at the 8th fet to get it to G. This gets the capo up and out of the way of your fretting hand.</p>\n<p>Clawhammer guitar is such a fun way to play once you get the basic technique down. After years of regular fingerpicking it has helped recharge my playing and add a different groove and drive to my repotiore. I definitely encourage folks to give it a shot.</p>\n",

You can fine Steve at <a href=\"http://www.celticguitar.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.celticguitar.com</a></p>\n<p>I believe Steve is playing a Circa guitar. I am not sure what they go for. Any guitar will work for clawhammer, I have seen that style played on dreadnoughts and small parlor guitars. I would think an Eric Clapton signature would work fine. I think Steve uses medium gauge strings, but light gauge would be good too. I prefer mediums, especially if i am tuning down.</p>\n"

For the traditional celtic song, The Month of Janruary, he lets the melody speak while a fiddle adds some nice textures underneath. I really like what he did with the folk standard Wildwood Flower, turning it into something entirely new. Autumn Roads is a groovy modern sounding number, the melody gliding along over a cool chord progression and bass line. My one of my favorite tracks is Red Snapper, a bluesy piece that the liner notes say is inspired by the classic duets of Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. Doug overdubbed two Martin guitars on this track, and the way the parts intertwine and complement each other is just really great. The title track is a smoky jazz piece played in an unusual alternate tuning.</p>\n<p>Doug&#8217;s recorded tone is superb, a testament to his fine playing and his ability as a recording engineer.

I apologize for the PDF not having the correct title. I seem to have lost the original file I created with my Sibelius notation software, as I did not learn the title of this tune until recently. </p>\n<p>One can play this piece pretty simply or fancy it up a bit. I play the triplets ring, middle, and index finger, and indicate them as much  with A M I, which is standard classical guitar notation. You can play them that way, or any other way you see fit. The important thing is the rhythm. I know some folks play them index, middle, and index. Tony Mcmanus uses his thumb nail for triplets on the bass strings, in a down up down motion. One option is to not play the triplets at all and just play a longer sustained note. That would work perfectly fine.   Then add them in later as your technique improves.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the bass note off the beat in measure six. I think its a nice unexpected variation but may trip you up the first time or two trying it. I really like how that sustained C note in measures three and seven allow you to do that C appregio into the next melody note. Its a nice technique to use when arranging pieces that have sustained melody notes.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the piece, and please do not hesitate to get in touch with questions.

Its point and click, one does not have to know any html or css code. It worked out great and was super convenient, but the DIY&#8217;er in me wanted a website on my own server space, where I could mess around with the code and dig into things. Plus I have been wanting to learn more about web development and WordPress, so i figured this was a good place to start.</p>\n<p>It was quite a process and I learned alot. I started by working through some basic CSS books to get a basic understanding of how that worked. Then I installed WordPress locally on my computer started modifying a basic theme called Toolbox. I changed the header and navigation menu around a bit, made the content area wider, and figured out how to have different sidebars display on different pages. Then I began the lengthy task of importing everything from my old blog, copying over the pictures to my local machine, and fixing all the links to reflect their new location. After everything was roughly in place I uploaded my WordPress theme and database to my new server space, fixed some settings, and surprisingly everything worked. There were a few moments of frustration and banging my head against the wall during the whole project, but all in all it went smoothly. I was lucky in that there was alot of information available online.</p>\n<p>So my site is up but I still have alot of tweaking to do.

      "rendered": "<p>I recently had a few nice gigs down in California, and wanted to write about them here.  If there is a mecca for instrumental music on acoustic guitar it may be the Bay Area of California. Many prominent guitarists live in the area, and there are a number of good guitar shops such as Guitar Solo in San Francisco, Gryphon Strings in Palo Alto, and Schoenbergs in Tiburon. In Santa Cruz you can’t throw a rock without hitting a luthier’s shop. So as someone that likes fine guitars and music I was excited to visit and gig, as well as see some friends and family.</p>\n<p>I’d like to say thanks to <a href=\"http://www.tejagerken.com\">Teja Gerken</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dougyoungguitar.com\">Doug Young</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.windsoracousticguitar.org/Windsor_Acoustic_Guitar_Series/Home.html\">Windsor Acoustic Concert Series</a> for arranging gigs for me, hosting, and making the trip possible. Its always great to play for an attentive audience, make new friends, and sell a few cd’s.</p>\n<p>My first gig was Teja Gerken’s acoustic guitar showcase. Teja is a senior editor at Acoustic Guitar Magazine, and has been running a monthly showcase at the Bazaar Cafe for ten years. The Bazaar is a great little place, with owners that love acoustic music. The gig is totally unamplified, and with fifteen people there it seems like a full house. Fellow celtic guitarist <a href=\"http://www.celticguitar.com\">Steve Baughman</a> joined Teja and I on this gig, so it was a great night of music. Steve and I played a duet on guitar and banjo which loads of fun. I got to meet <a href=\"http://www.azsamad.com\">Az Samad</a>, a fantastic local guitarist, and <a href=\"http://paramita.typepad.com/\">Hengsure</a>, who brought his Alberico OO for me to check out. Its a very nice, comfortable guitar.</p>\n<p>I stayed at Steve’s house that night, and we were up to late playing tunes and drinking Scotch, though I did most of the drinking. Steve is a good friend and teacher, and it was great to spend some time with him.</p>\n<p>A few days later Doug Young and I played a house concert up in Sanoma at the Windor Acoustic Concert series. Host Scott Nevin cooked us a great filet migon dinner before the show, and we had an intimate, attentive audience. House concerts are so much fun, and probably my favorite venue for music. They are usually in someone’s living room, played unamplified, and often include a potluck or dinner beforehand. There is a suggested donation jar, which usually all the proceeds going to the artist. House concerts are really taking off, with websites like <a href=\"http://www.concertsinyourhome.com\">Concerts In Your Home</a> helping to put artists in touch with hosts.</p>\n<p>My final gig of the tour was at Doug Young’s Acoustic Guitar Showcase in Santa Clara. Doug is another good friend, and let me stay at his place during my trip. I even managed to get a track recorded for an eventual second album while I was there. I have played Doug’s showcase before, and its always a good time. We were joined by Jennifer Martin, and played about eight tunes each. There was a nice crowd, and we even managed to webcast the show using Ustream. This was the first time trying this and it worked pretty well. Doug and I played two really fun duets. Created Hens, and an original tune of Doug’s in which i played a harmony part. Guitar duets are so nice, and Doug’s tune had some really fun passages where we both get to play fast.</p>\n<p>Besides the gigs I managed to get to a few guitar stores. One of my favorite shops in the Bay Area in <a href=\"http://www.gryphonstrings.com\">Gryphon Strings</a>. They always have a nice selection of guitars. There was a particularly sweet Santa Cruz FS in cedar/cocobolo that I played for quite a while. From what I understand the FS was designed partly by Jeff Taugott when he worked at Santa Cruz. It looks similar to Traugott’s instruments, and is designed primarly for the fingerstyle player. The one at Gryphon seemed super responsive, and I would have loved to have taken it home. You don’t see the FS around that much, and it was great to be able to play one. I also played some very fun ukulele&#8217;s by Collings. Super light with a quick responsive sound, and ideal for clawhammer banjo technique. It would be nice to have a uke to take along on camping trips.</p>\n<p>Another guitar shop I was very excited to visit was <a href=\"http://www.om28.com/\">Schoenbergs Guitars</a> in Tiburon. Its a fairly famous guitar shop, but in my previous visits I had never managed to get there. I had some time the day after my San Francisco gig, so I drove the half hour north of SF, across the Golden Gate bridge, to the touristy town of Tiburon. Schoenbergs is a super small store, but every inch is packed with guitars, all of them interesting. Some standouts included a Tony Yamamoto semi-baritone fan fret, a hundred year old Washburn parlor, and an Alberico OM. The Washburn was particularly cool, very small, lightly built, and super responsive. A guitar with a very old vibe. I also enjoyed the Yamamoto, and would not mind a baritone or semi baritone guitar one day. That low register is something totally different. It was also nice to play another one of Fabrizio’s OM’s and be able to compare it to my own. He does not build that many guitars, so coming across two in the same trip is rare indeed.</p>\n<p>I had really great time in California and am looking forward to going back and doing some recording. Thanks so much to Steve and Doug for providing me with a place to sleep, and Teja and Scott for the gigs. It was also nice to be in the sun for a week and somewhere where it is not cold and raining. Now its back to regular practicing and putting tunes together for the next cd.</p>\n[simpleviewer gallery_id=&#8221;1&#8243;]\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>I was pleasently suprised the other day to check my CDBaby account and find $40 worth of download purchases. Sure, it&#8217;s not a ton of dough, but for me every dollar counts. I am putting it all towards the funding of another cd.</p>\n<p>Being an independent musician playing a relatively niche style of music, I don&#8217;t exactly sell a ton of albums. I am happy with $100 a month from album sales, both physical and digital. I&#8217;ll sell the occasional cd at my coffee shop or wine bar type gigs. At something like a house concert or celtic festival where folks are there to see a specific style of music cd sales are usually better.&nbsp; The biggest challenge is just lack of visibility. It&#8217;s a big world out there and getting name and brand recognition take time. I don&#8217;t have a record label or publicity department behind me. Thankfully the internet has partly leveled the playing field in that regard, and I can proudly say that more people know about my music now than a year ago.</p>\n<p>I am already starting to contemplate another album. I&#8217;ve got ten or so tune arrangements kicking around in my head so far. I am envisioning some additional instrumentation, played either by myself or others. There will still be some solo guitar cuts as well, but more and more I am enjoying interacting with others when playing music.</p>\n<p>One thing I have been contemplating is doing a download only album. Manufacturing and shipping physical cd&#8217;s adds a decent amount to the cost. For my first album it cost $700 after shipping to manufactur and print 500 units of my cd in jewel cases. I think $200 of that was shipping, jewel cases are kind of bulky, I seem to remember Fedex delivering four or five boxes. One things folks suggested is go with the digipack format instead. They are less bulky, so shipping would be cheaper. I am not sure if the digipack option costs more to manufacture than a jewel case. I do like how they look.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are a whole lot of other things to consider if i were to release a download only album. It&#8217;s harder than sending a physical cd for review or airplay. I couldn&#8217;t sell cds at gigs, though I could sell digital download cards. Handing off a cd to a friend or family member is easy and convenient.</p>\n<p>Until recently, guitarist<span> <a href=\"http://www.simonfoxguitar.com\">Simon Fox</a></span> sold only digital download albums, though it seems now he is selling a physical cd. Though more folks are buying music from places like iTunes or Emusic, I think a lot of us still like holding a cd in our hands. Especially if I want to buy something at a live show.</p>\n<p>I guess I could always record an album and then not decide till the end if I wanted to print a physical cd. Or do a digital only release and put out a physical cd later on down the line.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n",

          "<p>I have decided to try and make the switch over to DADGAD tuning. This has taken a bit of thought for me, as I am quite familiar with Orkney tuning (CGDGCD), recorded an album in that tuning, and am happy playing backup in it. But I feel I am somewhat of a simplistic guitarist, only really playing in two positions in Orkney. In the key of C or G without a capo, or in the key of D or A with a capo at the second fret. I like to play backup with a capo at the second fret, but then if i want to flatpick a tune there is no open middle D string. So I end up taking the capo off, and all this switching back and forth messes with my knowledge of the notes on the fingerboard. I feel I am locked into playing my arrangements by muscle memory, and cannot be spontanous or free musically when I play. Of course could be a problem in any tuning.</p>\n<p>DADGAD to me seems a bit more versatile, perhaps due to the bass strings not being tuned down so low. It works well for celtic backup, and without a capo the keys of D, A, G, and C are readily available, with Bb and F seeming doable. I can flatpick tunes but also switch over to fingerstyle arrangements.</p>\n<p>I am having a good time working through <a href=\"http://www.dougyoungguitar.com\">Doug Young's</a> DADGAD book. Its very insightful and well laid out. I am going to strive and really do the work to learn my chords, scales, inversions, and modes all over the neck, so i can be a more complete guitarist.</p>\n<p>One thing that has given me some trouble is with my 2nd string tuned to A it seems to go out of tune as I go up the neck. I use medium guage strings, but am thinking about swapping out the 2nd string for a heavier one. Do folks out there have any other suggestions?</p>\n<p>Check out Pierre Bensusan below playing in DADGAD. Humbling and inspiring. I think it certainly shows that DADGAD can be used for a variety of sounds.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/UiVr89I7_0E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n"

One downside about Orkney is that flatpicking in it is not the easiest, in my opinion.&nbsp; I usually backup with a capo at the second fret, means the strings are tuned to DAEADE. So unlike most other tunings there is no open D note on the fourth string. This is kind of pivotal for celtic music, since that note comes up in tunes a lot. I could grab it on the fifth string fifth fret with my pinky, but that is kind of awkward, especially playing fast. </p>\n<p>I could also pull off the capo and then flatpick, which would give me an open D on the fourth string. But that is not my preferred configuration for backup, and I hate to switch back and forth.</p>\n<p>So enter this new tuning I have been playing with, CFCGCD. You can see its similar to Orkney except the fifth and fourth strings are tuned down another whole step. Steve Baughman uses it some on his newest cd and his celtic guitar DVD. I also recently found out that it has become one of John Doyle&#8217;s main tunings as well. If two guitarists I admire are using it I might as well try it out.</p>\n<p>Without a capo it obviously works well for the keys of C and F, but I think its main strengths are with a capo at the second fret, giving you the tuning of DGDADE. You&#8217;ve got open D and G notes in the bass, which are common in celtic music. If you ignore the sixth and second strings you get the notes GDAE, which are the same as the mandolin. Flatpicking in most of the common celtic keys seems easy enough. </p>\n<p>I have only worked out a handful of chords, and this is where it will probably just take a while to get used to some new things. I am so familiar with the chords in Orkney, and all the little riffs, runs, and tricks I can use the when backing up a tune.&nbsp; Now its just a matter of learning where those same shapes and sounds lie in this new tuning. </p>\n<p>I probably won&#8217;t totally switch tunings for good. I still know Orkney better and can see where it is more advantageous when arranging certain things for fingerpicking. But I am enjoying exploring this new tuning and trying some different things. </p>\n<p>To wrap things up I want to present a simple arrangement of the standard reel, The Mountain Road. Its nothing super complicated, just a standard melody plus baseline arrangement.&nbsp; I have included some triplets in places, which I usually play ring, middle, and index finger. ?I also vary the bassline a bit to make things more interesting. The arrow above certain notes indicaites a technique called the Middle Finger Thwack. You basically flick the given string with your index finger, produced the note but also a percussive effect.</p>\n<p>This tune works well with an arrangement of the Banshee, another traditional irish reel.

              "rendered": "<p>Why not try this, especially if you want to flat pick the tunes. I&#8217;ve been using this for about forty years now, I initially came to the guitar via the tenor banjo and wanted to quickly transfer the skill I had with the tenor tuning to the guitar, I use an open tuning of CFCGDG but usually capo at the 2nd fret, the only time I don&#8217;t capo is when accompanying Northumbrian pipes or flat keyed Uilleann pipes where the keys are usually F, C , Bb etc. The Capo&#8217;d guitar is basically a tenor banjo, middle four strings with a dropped D on bass and a high A on the top string. This has the many advantages of allowing you to cross strings at the treble end, without the stretching normally associated with f# to B or G to B etc, on the E string.   Mandolin/ octave mandolin chords are possible with only having to accommodate the bass D (which often helps as a drone) and accommodate the high A string which also rings nicely when in the key of A or E. Check out my recent cd&#8217;s Autumn, and Wall to Wall Lindifarne to Walltown , both on cd baby Amazon etc or available direct from me, and you&#8217;ll get the flavour, both these cd&#8217;s and the about to be released Wall to Wall,  Cowraik to Carlingford have tunes played  in this tuning and in standard EADGBE . I find after using this tuning for many years I now want to properly learn guitar and I&#8217;m mainly playing the melodies in standard tuning. Check out my website, <a href=\"http://www.martinmatthews.eu\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.martinmatthews.eu</a> it has news on the new cd and samples to listen to. Best, Martin Matthews.</p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Thanks Zac, I may check that out, perhaps setup a second guitar for it. I liked CFCGCD ok, seems good for flatpicking, ok for fingerstyle, but i just didnt like alot of the chord voicings. Things seemed to intonate weird, I think because the bass strings are tuned down so low. Honestly, the past few days I have really been enjoying DADGAD and may stick with that a bit. I can do the celtic fingerstyle thing, and rhythm backup, but can also branch out and do some pop or jazz fingerstyle arrangements if the mood strikes me. I wouldnt mind being a bit more versatile, and having a better overall knowledge of the fingerboard, and I think sticking to one tuning helps alot with that. I also recently saw Pierre Bensusan which was very inspiring in that regard.</p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Anton,<br /> You may also enjoy BEBF#BF, the original tuning John pioneered for a lot of his non drop-D guitar work. Same intervals as CFCGCD, except you get that high string, meaning you rarely if ever have to go out of first position for flatpicking tunes. Great for finger style and backing songs as well. makes a very nice alternative to DADGAD, especially with a capo at the third fret (DGDADA). Much of John&#39;s work is in this tuning. It does require heavy strings, though. I use a .72 on my 6th string and a .52 on my fifth string. Have fun!</p>\n<p>All the best,<br />Zac<br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/legertymusic\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.youtube.com/legertymusic</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/zacleger\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.myspace.com/zacleger</a></p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Thanks Alan. I am excited about using this tuning for flatpicking as well, semms like most of the common celtic keys are in easy reach. I do use medium strings. I went back and forth for a while, and used lights for a time, but i prefer the heavier tension and what i perceive as a bit fatter tone from mediums. Perhaps I will experiment with putting even heavier gauges on strings 6, 5, and 4, since they are being tuned down so low. Of course then i couldn&#39;t tune up to standard, but I guess that is why one has two guitars. </p>\n<p>My arrangement of the Banshee is in G, when capoed at the second fret. I like that this tuning works well for both D and G, and can see the key of A being doable too.  </p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Anton,</p>\n<p>Nice post, and arrangment.  I really like the potential this tuning has for flatpicking irish tunes.  Another way to look at the tuning is if you ignore the 1st and 6th string, you get GDAD, which is probably the most common bouzouki tuning &#8211; so for bouzouki players this tuning is a breeze!</p>\n<p>Do you use medium strings normally?  I think for CFCGCD, where you are lowering your bottom 3 strings so significantly, medium strings are a must.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your Banshee arrangment.  Is that in F (or G when capoed)?  That would be a great demonstration of how this tuning works well for two keys&#8230;</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />Alan</p>\n"

My technique has been feeling ok, but I have not been overly happy with my tone, and certain right hand finger combinations are feeling awkward. But I just went out and played the music I knew, and told myself to have a good time and play confidently.</p>\n<p>It went great; I felt totally relaxed, and it was great to be out gigging after some time off. I had several nice conversations with folks about my music, and people seemed to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>If you have a body of music and are feeling the desire to share it with others, go out and play! This can be as simple as inviting a few friends over for an informal living room show, or you could go out and setup a gig a local coffee shop or other appropriate venue. You might be surprised at how much it jumpstarts your playing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

He plays it in the clawhammer style, which is exactly the same technique that one would use on the banjo. Clawhammer guitar comes across a bit differently to me, the guitar having more sustain and all, but it really works well for some tunes.</p>\n<p>The second tune is a duet with his musical partner, Robin Bullock. It is a Breton tune, and appears on Steve&#8217;s latest cd, Life in Prism.</p>\n<p>On his celtic guitar <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00133D41A/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0786678933&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=14B8BY27W1J39D5R280V\">DVD</a> Steve says something that I have tried to remember, and to me is really apparent on these videos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The left hand is what you learn, but the right hand is what you are. &#8211; Steve Baughman</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the clawhammer tune even though he is playing quite fast, the music just comes flowing out, and his right hand is always relaxed. This can be the different between one&#8217;s music sounding effortless or plodding and forceful. I see the same thing in high level practitioners of any art, they make the difficult and impossible seem effortless and graceful.</p>\n<p>So how to accomplish this? I don&#8217;t think there is any magic pill or potion that will give you effortless guitar technique. Time with the instrument is an important factor, I know Steve practices daily.

              "rendered": "<p>Thanks for the comment Alan. I have have Steve&#39;s first Celtic Guitar Method book too, and really went through it in my earlier days. Learning his huge arrangement of Greensleeves was quite a fun undertaking. Being able to learn and dissect his arrangements gave me alot of insight into developing my own things. The Breton Riff section from his DVD is great too, it really allows you to play those tunes effortlessly once you get the basics down.</p>\n<p>I agree with your thoughts on clawhammer for guitar, some tunes work great, others not to so much. I worked up a passable version of the Fall of Richmond that Steve plays above, which is alot of fun. One thing i have enjoyed alot is high fiving my second guitar, replacing the fifth string with a first string. Check out my version of <a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/blog/2010/1/21/lord-mayo-clawhammer-guitar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lord Mayo</a>, which i think came out well.</p>\n<p>Glad you are enjoying the blog.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Hi Anton.  I agree with everything in this post.  I&#39;ve gotten alot out of Steve&#39;s DVD, especially with regards to right hand technique.  I also recommend Steve&#39;s first book from more than 10 years ago &quot;Celtic Fingerstyle Method&quot; with transcriptions to his Drop of the Pure album.  I learned (and still am learning) a heck of a lot from that book.</p>\n<p>I also play clawhammer guitar (and banjo), and agree that clawhammer guitar works great on some tunes, but not as much on others.  I think it has alot to do with melody vs. brushing approach, and tempo.  Notey stuff works on clawhammer guitar, as long as there isn&#39;t incessant brushing/strumming or heavy &quot;bum-ditty&quot;.  I REALLY like clawhammer guitar for slow tunes, such as Steve&#39;s version of Hard Times or Brushy Fork.  The sustain really works with the overlapping notes.</p>\n<p>Thanks for keeping this blog going.  I&#39;m a loyal reader, just don&#39;t post much.  I&#39;ve also gotten alot out of your arrangments and lessons on arranging.  Great stuff!</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Alan B, Raleigh NC</p>\n"

Besides music my other main hobbies are Brazillian Juijitsu(BJJ), and alongside that, strength and conditioning training.

              "rendered": "<p>Thanks William.  Yea, I am not sure if folks who play sports make better musicians. I do think one can draw parallels between practicing for the two things, I see music alot like a sport. Though we are just using our two hands, possibly our mouth, and the instrument. One is still building a physical skill, muscle memory, and trying to execute that skill the same time whenever you pick up your instrument. </p>\n<p>As far as focusing on the the present, that is harder. Its rare that I get there myself, when playing guitar. I try to segment my practice sessions, so there is a time when I am being very deliberate, focusing on technique, stopping to correct my mistakes, and really analyze things. But usually after I am warmed up and have done some sort of technique practice I like to give myself some time to just sit and play.  Usually its pieces or tunes that I know well or have been playing long enough that they are in muscle memory. I find its with these pieces that I am most often in the &quot;zone&quot; I have to worry less about the physical execution of it and can concentrate solely on making the music.  Striving for perfect tone, relaxing in both hands, really making things sing.  I think I can do that because the larger issues of where my left hand should be fretting and my right hand should be picking are already taken care of. So its easier to really narrow in on the little things.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">For the past few days I have been borrowing a Rode NT2-A microphone from a friend.&nbsp; I am not neccessarily in the market, but its rare that one gets to demo these kind of things, especially in your own home with your own gear.&nbsp; So I figured it would be a good opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">The Rode is a large diaphram condensor mic, with multiple patterns, a high pass filter, and a pad.&nbsp; It feels solidly built and retails for around $400.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">My friend who lent me the mic was raving about its low self noise specs, which according do the web literature are around 7db.&nbsp; So I was interested in that, especially since most of the time I will be recording fingerpicked guitar, which is not a relatively loud source.&nbsp; I have not used enough mics to really know if there is a difference between 7db and say, 15db.&nbsp; I would think recording in my house there is probably enough ambient noise that it doesnt make a differenence. Its far from a professional studio.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">The Rode is switchable between omni, cardoid, and figure eight.&nbsp; I chose the cardoid pattern, it probably being the most common for acoustic guitar.&nbsp; From what I hear Omni can be nice in a good room, and it does not exhibit a proximity effect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">I first attempted to record in my front room, which is about ten by ten feet, with wood floors and bare walls.

              "rendered": "<p>Hi Anton &#8211; great blog you have here.  I tried your transcript of the Irish Sea and really like it.  I am trying to work out a version of the Butterfly Jig in the same tuning, that could be added as part of a medley with the Irish Sea.  Have you ever tried the Butterfly in this tuning (or any other)?  Some of the fingering appears a bit difficult for the higher notes.  I&#39;m inspired by Kim Robertson&#39;s rendition of the Butterfly that she did on her harp CD Windsongs (also on other compilations, like the Harvest Moon cd).  I like the way she walks the bass notes down on some passages.  </p>\n<p>thanks,</p>\n<p>Keith</p>\n<p>Honolulu</p>\n"

At least for me.  But steel strings chew up my nail to much, which sucks when i want to fingerpick the guitar.  </p>\n<p>Gut strings on fiddle would be interesting.  I wonder what that would sound like.  </p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

What a great sound!</p>\n<p>I was looking at a friend&#39;s great-grandfather&#39;s violin, which only has two strings left on it, which are both gut strings 80+ years old. I was surprised at how fat they were. I wonder what they&#39;d sound like, but I wouldn&#39;t buy a gut set for myself, and that violin is in such poor shape, I doubt it could withstand having those two strings tuned up to pitch. Maybe I&#39;ll see if anyone makes nylon strings for violins&#8230;</p>\n"

Usually before each tune I will try to talk a bit about, perhaps relate some personal story as to who I learned the tune from or something like that. Sometimes if a joke or something funny occurs to me I will try it, and if I get a good reaction I mentally file that one away for next time.

              "rendered": "<p>Great post. The Bach cello suite I&#8217;m working on right now is full of places where something repeats, but the second time the thing that follows it is different. I&#8217;d had a lot of trouble with it, where I end up going back to the first thing instead of continuing where I was, if my mind&#8217;s not fully in it. It&#8217;s like when you know two tunes that start the same way, if you&#8217;ve just played one it can be really hard to play the other. I think the standard advice is the right thing; work on these things slowly enough that you can&#8217;t rely on muscle memory, and mentally play ahead of where you are physically playing. Sometimes carelessness or just lack of focus while learning these trouble spots can lead to them being an ongoing problem.</p>\n<p>I have tried mentally focusing on what I am about to play on stage a few times, too, minus the playing at 1/4th speed part. I mean, mentally playing just a split second before physically. It really helped, not just to keep me on track but it raised the level of my conscious participation in the performance and it certainly made it a lot more exciting for me. And who has time to be nervous when you&#8217;re focused like that? It can be kind of draining when it&#8217;s not the habit yet, though.</p>\n"

      "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Hi Folks,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">One of my readers suggested i post a blog topic about technique, how i work through an arrangement, getting a tune up to speed, etc.&nbsp; I thought i would try to cover some of the topics in the context of working through an arrangement from start to finish.&nbsp; That way folks can see where i am coming from, and more importantly to me, gain an understanding of the tools they need to start arranging their own tunes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">The tune we will be looking is Tobin&#8217;s Jig, also called Tobin&#8217;s Favorite, with both TAB/Notation and audio examples.&nbsp; Its a standard at sessions, played in the key of D, and thus works well in the CGDGCD tuning with the capo at the 2nd fret.&nbsp; So you will want to download the lesson pdf for the tab and notation, as well as the mp3 examples. This entry will get into the A part, and the next blog entry will look at the B part, plus the whole piece. Maybe I will record some video too. I have intentionally played the guitar examples slower and more flowing, so folks can hear whats going on. The final version will be more up to speed.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\"><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/tobinsApart.pdf\">Lesson PDF Download</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/tobinsflute.mp3\">Tobins on flute</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/tobins1.mp3\">Example 1 Audio</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/tobins2.mp3\">Example 2 Audio</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/tobins3.mp3\">Example 3 Audio</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">As far as technique goes, i am principally rooted in classical guitar technique.&nbsp; I studied classical guitar for several years while in high school and college, and pretty much went from that straight into arranging celtic tunes.&nbsp; I found the technique carries over pretty well to playing this kind of music, though it is certainly not the only approach.&nbsp; Robin Bullock uses finger picks and Tony Mcmanus uses a different right hand attack. Find what works for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">I think being able to play scales using various of permutations of Index, Middle, and Ring fingers with the right hand, as well as different right hand appregios, will serve one well when fingerpicking this music.&nbsp; I started out with Aaron Scheerer&#8217;s Classical Guitar book, and I like Pumping Nylon alot as well, especially the Guillini appregios in the back.&nbsp; Even though I don&#8217;t specifically play classical guitar music anymore I use alot of the warm up studies in Pumping Nylon, they are valuable for any fingerpicking guitar style.&nbsp; In fact, I think if you are not already committed to a certain fingerpicking style getting a basic grounding in classical guitar technique can&#8217;t hurt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">I have not been using a metronome lately, though that is probably just lack of discipline on my part.&nbsp; Once i get an arrangement into muscle memory i tend to just play it over and over, refining things until its up to speed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">So lets look at Tobin&#8217;s Jig.&nbsp; When setting out to arrange a tune i always listen to it alot first.&nbsp; At home, in the car, etc.&nbsp; I get it in my ear and under my skin, trying to absorb the melody, lilt, and delivery.&nbsp; Then I sit down and actually try to learn the tune.&nbsp; I always encourage folks to learn traditional music by ear, though sheet music is fine when first starting out.&nbsp; I feel learning by ear is the best way to absorb the rhythm that is so neccesary to this music, you will remember tunes better, and eventually get to the point where you can pick up things on the fly at the session.&nbsp; Windows Media Player and Quicktime will slow down mp3&#8217;s, which is handy when learning some of the fast stuff.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\"><strong>Tobins on flute</strong><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">So in that vein the first audio example is me playing Tobin&#8217;s Jig on the flute, as i would at a session. I play the full tune, both A and B parts, though in this blog entry we will just cover the A part. If you are not familiar with the tune or don&#8217;t have another recording of it listen to this for a while, to get it in your head. If i were to go to session this how i would play it. Its pretty close to the guitar version though there may be some minor differences.&nbsp; That is fairly common in celtic music.<br /></span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Example 1</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">The next step i take is to pick up the guitar and learn the melody, usually where it naturally falls on the instrument.&nbsp; I am not really concerned with much more than getting the melody down on the guitar, so i can step away from the recording and have a basic framework to develop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Example 1 demonstrates the basic melody with a simple bass line underneath.&nbsp; This based on the principal chords of the tune, which are D, G, and A.&nbsp; Major key tunes will often revolve around the I, IV, and V chords, so its not a bad place to start.&nbsp; To get the proper rhythm for jigs i tend to pick every note, so there are not any slurs in this piece. This basic version does not go above the third fret, and i think is a nice place to start.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Example 2</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">I varied it up a bit in example 2, adding some additional bass notes. They all still fall on beats 1 and 4, the main rhymic emphasis for jigs.&nbsp; Often times instead of D major one can substitute B minor, hence the B note in the first measure.&nbsp; Instead of an A note in the measure 2 i use a C sharp.&nbsp; If i were backing this tune I might play an A chord with a C sharp in the bass at this point. This version also ventures up the neck a bit.&nbsp; Depending on the context, alot of times i find the first string can sound kind of thin, so i like play things higher up the neck on different string to vary the tonal quality. Measures 3 and 4 of example two demonstrate that.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Example 3</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Example 3 changes things up a bit more, and is probably the most difficult of the three versions.&nbsp; I changed the placement of the bass notes to add a bit different rhythmic emphasis.&nbsp; Take the time to try this out, it can take a bit of coordination to get the thumb going in the right spot.&nbsp; I also play a few more passages up the neck, which i think is nice.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">In an arrangement i might use all three of these variations at various points through the tune, it gives the listener some variety and is also nice for me as a player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">In the next blog entry we will look at the B part. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Feel free to post your questions or thoughts to comments, or shoot me an email.</span></p>\n",

Its a stripped down version of their Sibelius software, and ran about $100. It has now been replaced by Sibelius First, which looks to do the same thing, for the same price. G7 works fine for me, but unfortunately when I installed Snow Leopard on the Mac it stopped working.  Looking on the Sibelius website they stopped supporting G7, and now apparently want you to buy the new product.  Typical i guess. Other pieces of software are Finale, and Notion, which is new and has a nice demo to try.  I think they all work quite well, its just a matter of what you are looking for.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

After about 10 minutes of enthusiastic playing it snapped, so much for that idea.  </p>\n<p>Steve Baughman has railroad spikes on his guitar, I&#8217;ve thought about getting some for mine, but i dont know.  I think i am just going to order a Third Hand Capo today, which lets you capo individual strings.  I can just swap out my sixth string for a regular B string, and put the Third Hand up at the 8th fret. That way it gets the string to G and is not in my way for playing the tune.  </p>\n<p>Cool to hear you play clawhammer banjo too.  I picked up an old Lyon and Healy a few months ago and have been messing around on it.  I only know a handful of tunes at the moment. I find the clawhammer style very satisfying and relaxing to play.  I initially arranged Lord Mayo on the banjo, but it sounds better on the guitar, where you have more sustain.</p>\n<p>Ill get that tune up soon.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

If I were you, and had a .012 &#8211; well, you could easily tune it up to an F, or MAYBE an F#, and then just tune your other strings down accordingly.  I think Alec Stone Sweet just tunes on up to G!</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br />Alan</p>\n"

In that time i have compiled a handful of tunes that i like, and started to seriously think about doing a cd a few years ago. But i kept putting it off, wasnt the right time, etc. Then i moved out to Portland, OR three years ago, which put me closer to two friends in California, Steve Baughman and Doug Young. I had met them both at the Swannonoa Gathering and saw them pretty regularly over the years at camp. When i first brought up recording a cd Steve offered to produce it, and Doug offered the use of his home studio. I knew i had a good team here, as Steve has been a teacher of mine over the past few years and knows my playing quite well. Doug is well established in the acoustic guitar scene, has top notch gear, and knows how to use it. So i knew i would be able to get a good sound, and had two other folks i trusted to give me good feedback on my decisions.</p>\n<p>Before all this i had toyed with the idea of recording at home. Alot of solo guitarists record at home in very modest studios. I would have to drop a bit of money on gear, but afterwards it would be mine and i could do future albums at home for free. However in the end i decided against this approach. I was not really in the position to modify my room with acoustic treatment, my house is on a fairly busy street, and i just didnt feel i knew enough at that point to get a reliable sound i trusted. I wanted this first cd to be as good as possible, and did not want to have to second guess sound quality or mic placement. Flying down to California was an added cost, but i feel in the end it will have been worth it. Now that i have a good baseline for what a professional cd should sound like i may try to record future albums at home, if i can assemble the right gear and acoustically treat my room.</p>\n<p>Working with a producer was also something i had to think about. Its a dynamic i had never experienced before, plus is also an added cost. In the end having Steve there was well worth it, and i would reccomend a producer to other folks if you can afford and know someone who fits the role. Being able to just go in the studio and play, while Steve noted down which takes and parts were keepers was a big load of my mind. Doug worried about setting up the mics, running the computer, and editing. Both of them offered up their thoughts when i was wondering about a take or certain part. Steve was very good about getting the best playing out of me, and encouraging me to play louder.</p>\n<p>I managed to record all twelve tracks in two seperate sessions, one in April and another in Sept of 2009. The first time was 8 tracks over the course of 2 days i think, and the second time i did the remaining 4 tracks in one day. Overall i would say things went smoothly, and part of that i attribute to being fairly well prepared. Being that i had to pay to fly down there, plus other expenses, i wanted to get the most out of each trip as possible. I would reccomend this to anyone going into a studio, whether its local or out of town. Practice up, do some demo recordings at home on a simple recorder to get used to the red light and the microphone. Its funny how much ones playing goes down hill once the record button is hit. I would say each track took about an hour to an hour and half, though some were definitely more. Thats recording and editing the takes into a final master take. Some of the stuff Doug accomplished with digital editing was pretty cool. Its certainly more effecient than hoping for one magical perfect take.</p>\n<p>After all the recording was done the cd was mixed by Doug at his place. Mastering was done Cass Anawaty at Sunbreak Music up here in Portland. I wanted to work with someone local so i could pop in and talk about music and the sound i wanted, and Doug mentioned that Cass mastered Larry Pattis&#8217;s latest cd. Cass is also a Michael Hedges fan and has studied guitar with Alex De Grassi, so i knew i would be getting someone familiar with the acoustic guitar genre. We met up, had coffee, and talked about music. Cass is a really nice guy, listened to what i had to say about my sound, made some suggestions of his own, and off we went.</p>\n<p>I felt the mixed version straight from Doug&#8217;s sounded good, and would probably stand up fine as a cd on its own. But i want this to be a professional cd as possible, and to me the mastered result is smoother, more spacious in places, and of course louder.</p>\n<p>What type of manufacutring to get also involved a bit of decision making. The standard run is a 1000 real cds for about a $1000. Any less and they are usually CD-R&#8217;s. Which would be fine, but again, i want this to be a professional release as possible. Kind of like printing your resume on regular paper vs something nice. But i don&#8217;t really want to spend a $1000 at the moment. Asking around Doug (LittleBrother) over on the Acoustic Player Magazine forum referred me to Copycat Media, as he had just used them for a project with good results. I sent off for a quote, and was able to get 500 real cds, full color 4 panel artwork, 3 color on disc printing, plus a barcode for about $600. I will most likely go with them, though i want to check out Doug&#8217;s CD. 500 units seems like a good first run to start with. Hopefully i will sell a bunch, and will end up giving alot away for promotional and gigging purposes, as well as gifts.</p>\n<p>There were also some extranous expenses that i didnt think about. Three of the songs on the cd are not public domain, so i had contact the authors and pay them mechanical rights, which are about a $100 each. Not a ton of money but it adds up on a personally financed project like this. I also decided to register for ISRC codes (i think thats what they are called). Basically its a code for each track that the mastering guy can embed on the final disc. They are unique for each track, and are used to track statistics for digital downloads, which is neccessary these days.

Ideally listen to it on a traditional instrument for that idiom, in this case fiddle, flute, pipes, whistle, accordian, tenor banjo, etc.&nbsp; <br />2.&nbsp; Learn the melody on guitar.&nbsp; Be able to play it from memory.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t worry about adding harmony or anything yet, just get the melody firmly under your fingers so when you start to think about adding a bass line or harmony, you are not forgetting where the melody is.<br />3. Come up with a basic bass line at first that fits the melody.&nbsp; This will usually be based around obvious chords.&nbsp; In this case, its G, C, and D</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">I&#8217;ve recorded myself playing it on flute so you can hear how it might sound traditionally.&nbsp; Below that is a pdf of the melody in notation and TAB.&nbsp; I have tried to notate it as i play it on flute, but there may be a slight difference.&nbsp; Such is folk music.&nbsp; As far as the tab i just laid the melody out on guitar, not taking into account different positions on the neck.&nbsp; More on that later.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/fatherkellys.mp3\"><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Father Kelly&#8217;s flute</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\"><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/fatherkellys.pdf\">Melody PDF</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Next i have arranged the melody a bit on guitar, adding some simple bass notes that represent the chords i might play.&nbsp; This is super simple, and i have not really taken into account yet the best place to the melody on the neck so it flows and is not so stacatto.&nbsp; Except where the few slurs are indicated each note is picked, my main rule of thumb is not to use the same finger on the right hand consecutively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\"><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/FatherKellys2.pdf\">Father Kellys Basic Arrangement</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\"><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/fatherkellys2.mp3\">Basic Arrangement MP3</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">As you can hear, the basic arrangement is pretty rough sounding, not at all flowing as it might sound on the fiddle or flute.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">So check those out, perhaps try to improve it some on your own, and then next week i will post part 2, where we will flesh out the arrangement a bit more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">thanks,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Anton Emery<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n",

Those basic student method books helped alot in ingraining good technique from the start.  I think its something alot of folks could benefit from, even if they end up wanting to play another style later on.  </p>\n<p>Right now i have been working through the Play-Relax technique in the Natural Classical Guitar book.  Basically doing a free stroke with I finger, returning it to the start position, totally relaxing the hand, then planting with the M finger, and doing the same thing.  I think eventually if i can consistently plant at the same spot on my finger all the time i will have a more consistent tone overall.</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

      "rendered": "<p>Over the past few weeks i have been changing up my position when playing solo guitar. Usually i play in the more common position, guitar on the right knee, pretty parallel to the ground.</p>\n<p>With this position my picking hand seems to fall naturally to that space between the soundhole and the bridge. Not overly bad, and to me my hand feels more &#8220;secure&#8221; there, perhaps due to the higher string tension. But i think this makes my tone a bit more bright and crisp than i would like.<br />\nSo i have switched up to the classical position. That is when one uses a footstool, or in this case, my guitar case, to prop up the left leg, putting the guitar at more of an angle. It feels more natural for me to position my hand directly over the sound hole this way, getting more of that &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; where the guitar sounds big and warm. It also seems to put my hand at ore of a 90 degree angle to the strings, which seems to improve the tone a bit. I also dont tend to slouch over the guitar as much this way, is better for me and probably lets it resonate more.</p>\n<p>Some folks have reported problems using a foot stool, apparently having their foot elevated like that is bad for the hip and spine. I never had that problem when i studied classical guitar in high school and college, but i dont want to have to cart a footstool around with me everywhere. I am looking into getting something like the Ergoplay sometime. I have tried similar products, and they were quite comfortable.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/regularposition.jpg\"><img title=\"regularposition\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/regularposition.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">regular position</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/classicalposition.jpg\"><img title=\"classicalposition\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/classicalposition.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Classical position</p></div>\n",

It feels more natural for me to position my hand directly over the sound hole this way, getting more of that \"sweet spot\" where the guitar sounds big and warm.

I also dont tend to slouch over the guitar as much this way, is better for me and probably lets it resonate more.\r\n\r\nSome folks have reported problems using a foot stool, apparently having their foot elevated like that is bad for the hip and spine. I never had that problem when i studied classical guitar in high school and college, but i dont want to have to cart a footstool around with me everywhere.

Its been fun putting up on content on the blog, i am glad folks are getting something out of it.  </p>\n<p>My flute is made by Jon Cochran.  He is a part time maker that lives in Los Angles, so the flute was a good bit cheaper than alot of the full time makers.  Its pitched in D, has six holes, and it made of blackwood.  its a great flute and i really enjoy playing it.  Eventually i might like an instrument with some keys, but for now this one is fine.  </p>\n<p>I dont think he has a website, but sometimes his instruments show up at the <a href=\"http://www.irishflutestore.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.irishflutestore.com</a>  In addition they might be able to tell you how to get in touch with him.  I also know he hangs around the flute forum at <a href=\"http://www.chiffandfipple.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.chiffandfipple.com</a>, so you could leave a message for him there as well.</p>\n<p>thanks alot,</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

I love playing in orkney for celtic tunes, but use dadgad for pretty much anything else I play &#8211; including some celtic stuff.</p>\n<p>How about an old chestnut, that I haven&#8217;t seen arranged THAT much &#8211; Carolan&#8217;s Concerto.  Alec Stone Sweet does a great version in dadgad on &quot;Memory and Praise&quot;.  I think John Renbourn did a version in open G a long time ago.  Should work pretty well in orkney, either in C or G.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />Alan</p>\n"

Even with mediums it takes a more sensitive touch in the left and right hands not to play the string sharp. </p>\n<p>If I am doing celtic backup in Orkney I usually capo at II, which brings the low C up to a D. </p>\n<p>Depending on your level Steve&#8217;s Celtic Guitar Method book may be a bit of a handful. The pieces in there are not overly easy. This other book of his easier and a great introduction to different tunings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mel-Bay-Beginning-Open-Tunings/dp/0786670932\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.amazon.com/Mel-Bay-Beginning-Open-Tunings/dp/0786670932</a></p>\n"

I think I&#8217;ve managed to work out most of the second tune by ear.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m having mixed success with the tuning. I often find the low C on on my guitar is not very resonant when fretted; I think the lack of string tension really hurts the tone. It&#8217;s also very easy to bend the slack strings sharp (though this maybe has a good side, as it forces more care and a relaxed hand when playing). </p>\n<p>Mostly I use the guitar for song accompaniment, and while I find strumming a lot easier with these tunings, fingerpicking I find much harder for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Thanks for the tip about Steve&#8217;s book; I&#8217;ll take a look. Keep up the great music!</p>\n"

Steve&#8217;s Celtic Guitar Method is a great resource, and I have a handful of transcriptions here on my website. </p>\n<p>I never transcribed the second welsh tune in the major key. I a few people have asked for various tunes off my cd, so I am thinking I should sit down for a month and transcribe the whole album.

I managed to record eight tunes, with Doug engineering and Steve producing. Very fun stuff, though kind of tiring at times. Listening back i think everything sounds pretty good so far.<br />\nI arrived at Doug&#8217;s on Thursday night, and we experimented with mic placement for a few hours. We settled on a spaced pair of Schoeps, and a pair of Nuemanns setup in XY. They both sounded pretty good on their own, and we figured we could just record them all, and then later figure out what we wanted to use.</p>\n<p>Steve got there on Friday and we started in on recording. I sat in the recording chair, Doug was at the controls, and Steve sat behind me in a recliner taking notes on a pad of paper. He didnt want me seeing him writing and getting distracted. I would do a bunch of takes, and he would listen and write comments on each one. Then we would go back and find the best take to be our master, and then fix any mistakes we needed using edits from the other takes. I think this arrangement worked out pretty well. I only had to worry about playing, Doug only had to worry about editing and the computer, and Steve could just listen and notate things.</p>\n<p>We managed to get three tunes done the first day, three the second, and then two on Sunday. Some took a few hours and others came quicker. I seem to recall doing 15 takes at one point. I would play, Steve would say &#8220;lets hear that again&#8221;, and i would play it again over and over. It was really good to have someone else there to tell me when things were good enough, or when it could be improved. If i had done this on my own it probably would have taken me forever.<br />\nI was amazed at Doug&#8217;s editing ability. Since we recorded with two sets of mics Doug had to keep all those seperate sound files lined up and grouped correctly when we edited. He did a fantastic job, and i am really appreciative.</p>\n<p>A big thanks to Doug&#8217;s wife Teri who kept us fed with wonderful food, as well as tasty beverages and a never ending supply of coffee for me.  Its going to take another trip to get the rest of the tunes, then i have to get it mixed, mastered, artwork done, and duplication. Not a cheap endeavor. I hope to have it done by the end of the year.  I am really looking forward to it.  A big thanks to Doug and Steve, i couldn&#8217;t do it without you guys.</p>\n[simpleviewer gallery_id=&#8221;2&#8243;]<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-137 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/2009/back-from-the-studio/beer/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/beer.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-257\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-257'>\n\t\t\t\tbeer break\n\t\t\t\t</dd></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/2009/back-from-the-studio/mics/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/mics.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/2009/back-from-the-studio/monitors/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/monitors.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-259\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-259'>\n\t\t\t\tWhere Doug did all the hard work\n\t\t\t\t</dd></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/2009/back-from-the-studio/playing/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/playing.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-260\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-260'>\n\t\t\t\tRecording time\n\t\t\t\t</dd></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/2009/back-from-the-studio/team/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/team.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-261\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-261'>\n\t\t\t\tThe recording team\n\t\t\t\t</dd></dl>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\n",

      "rendered": "<p>In the next few weeks i will be posting a series of standard dance tunes, showing how i might back up each one in the Orkney tuning, and then finally stringing them together in a set.  For folks that done use Orkney, i think the concepts will be applicaple to any tuning, you&#8217;ll just have to find your own chord shapes.</p>\n<p>Backing up celtic  music on guitar is an interesting thing.  For starters, the music has existed for centuries (at least) without any rhythmic at all, except for the goatskin drum called the bodrhan.  Guitar didnt enter the picture till the early 1900&#8217;s, and didnt really start getting refined as a backup instrument till the 60&#8217;s.  So you get melody players occasionally on the traditional instruments (flute, fiddle, pipes, etc) who don&#8217;t like any rhythmic back at all.  Fair enough, i think there is room for everyone in this type of music.  Plus then folks who only play guitar can learn to play a melody instrument.</p>\n<p>Being that alot of folks play guitar, and celtic sessions are often held in public places, you often get pepole from other styles wanting to join in, and more often than not it doesn&#8217;t go over very well.  Celtic tunes have their own specific rhythms, and certain types of chords sound more appropriate than others.  For someone wanting to bring their guitar down to the local pub to play along, a certain amount of studying at home is first neccessary, and even then you might go to the session and just listen for a while.  I am not trying to dissuade anyone from playing this wonderful music, but i wouldnt go to a jazz session expecting to be able to sit right in.  Celtic backup may seem simple at first, and in a way it is, but its also not.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to list a few things that i think someone should have a grasp on before they wander down to the local session with their guitar.  These are not in order of importance neccessarily.</p>\n<p>1.  <strong>Be able to figure out what key the tune is in</strong>.  Obviously quite important.  Its nice on guitar because you can sit and quietly pluck a string or chord till you figure out the key.  Most celtic tunes are either in G, D, Am, Em, Dm, Amaj, or Bm.  Ideally you would be able to figure out the key, and know from memory what chords work in that key.  So for the D you would have D, Emin, F#min, Gmaj, Amaj, Bmin, C#dim, and D.  For the C#dim i usually play an A with a C# in the bass.</p>\n<p>2.  <strong>Learn your rhythms.</strong>  Rhythm is probably the mostly important thing in celtic music.  I would rather play with someone who had good rhythm and used simple chords vs someone who knew alot of chordal tricks but didnt not have good rhythm.  Its dance music after all.  Reels are in 4/4, not unlike bluegrass, but the boom chuck of bluegrass often does not work with celtic music.  Celtic music emphasizes the beats 1 and 3, and bluegrass 2 and 4.  So when a good bluegrass player comes to an irish session and decides to play rhythm tne boom chuck often tends to drag the rhythm.  Not good.  I can&#8217;t explain a formal method to backing up reels.  Get a bunch of cds with players you like and try to emulate their rhythm.  For me it was just alot of trial and error, and strumming along in my bedroom.  It helps to find cds relatively sparse instrumentation and perhaps only one backup instrument, so you can play along and hear everything.  Here is a list of a few artists/cds that i like to play along to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.joshuadukes.com/\">Josh Dukes</a> &#8211;  Far from Home</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.coyotebanjo.com/\">Chris Smith</a> &#8211;  Coyoete Banjo</p>\n<p>Alan and John Kelly &#8211;

I just stumbled on this blog, though I&#8217;ve seen your name from different celtic guitar forums over the years.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a fellow fingerstyle guitarist, of the celtic and old-time persuasion.  Like you, I&#8217;ve gotten advice and encouragement from Steve over the years, though in my case it&#8217;s mainly been through his teaching materials and e-mails.</p>\n<p>Best of luck, and let all of your readers know how it goes!</p>\n<p>Alan</p>\n"

Playing other folks arrangements is fun, but eventually i wanted to put my own stamp on things, or arrange tunes no one else had done before.</p>\n<p>In this blog entry we will look at arranging the standard the Kesh Jig, for guitar.</p>\n<p>Arranging celtic music can be a bit tricky at first, especially for those used to playing traditional american styles on the guitar. The alternating thumb/travis picking technique doesn&#8217;t impart the right rhythm, and is not practical on the faster tunes. A different approach is neccessary to make the melodies flow like they would on the traditional instruments. A useful thing to remember is that these melodies are usually played on instruments like the fiddle, pipes, flute, and tin whistle. On these its easy to play to legato, not having to pick or articulate every note. Picking up a guitar and picking every single note can often times sound staccato and choppy. One of things we will look at is various ways to smooth out the melody.</p>\n<p>There are some basic steps that i run through when arranging a tune. They are:</p>\n<p>1. Learn the melody till you have it cold, this can be with pick, fingers, whatever</p>\n<p>2. Learn to play the melody in several different places on the neck</p>\n<p>3. Start to incorporate bass line/harmony</p>\n<p>4. Practice it</p>\n<h3>Learn the Melody</h3>\n<p>I prefer to learn tunes by ear, played on traditional instruments if possible.  I feel for traditional music learning by ear is the way to go.  It may be tough in the beginning, but once you spend some time you will learn tunes qucker and retain them easier.  A lot of celtic tunes move at a brisk pace, so its useful to use software to slow them down while retain the pitch.  The Amazing Slow Downer and Trasncribe are two popular choices.  Quicktime player for Mac and Windows Media Player for Windows are two free options that will also slow down audio files.</p>\n<p>Learn the melody till you can play it from memory.  Having a solid grasp of the melody will make it easier once we start exploring options for an arrangement.</p>\n<h3>Melodic Choices</h3>\n<p>Once you can play the melody solid you&#8217;ll want to start experiement with playing it all over the neck of the guitar.  This is the time to start using different strings for certain melody notes, which can change the texture, and to start to think about melodic vs linear playing.</p>\n<p>Melodic technique is playing consecutive melody notes on different strings.  This allows the notes to sustain more and prevents the melody form sounding choppy.  Linear playing is voicing conecutive notes on the same string. Check out the two passages from O&#8217;Carolans Recipet and The Kesh Jig, which we will be learning in this article</p>\n<p><strong>Tab Notation Examples</strong> &#8211;<strong><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/melodiclinear.pdf\">Linear vs Melodic</a><a href=\"http://celticfingerstyleguitar.squarespace.com/storage/blog-content/melodiclinear.pdf\"><br />\n</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Audio Clip</strong><strong> &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/linearmelodic.mp3\">Linear/Melodic</a></strong><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>One technique is not neccessarily better than the other, they are just both options to consider.  One thing i like to do when looking for melodic options is to voice a note higher up on the neck instead of on the first or second string.  For example in Orkney tuning a G on the first string fifth fret sounds alot differnt than a G on third string twelfth fret.  If you really want a nice thick tone or make a certain note cry this is a good technique to consider.</p>\n<h3>Bass and Harmony</h3>\n<p>Next we want to start filling out the melody by starting to add a bass line.  Celtic music is not very complex harmonically. Tunes are usually in one of a few basic keys, and tend to stay there for the entire time. Basic diatonic chords for harmony work great. The main challenge (or at least one of them) with celtic fingerstyle guitar is finding a way to play the melody so it flows well, and be able to add in interesting bass and harmony.</p>\n<p>Once you can play a melody cleanly from memory its time to start thinking about a bass line.  If you learned a tune from a recording you could just play along with it strumming chords to see what fits.  Some of you may be good enough to hear in your head where the harmony should go.  Once you figure out the basic chords work out a bassline that represents those chords.  So for a simple tune like the Kesh Jig whose chords are based around G, C, and D, my bass line might just be G, C, and D notes in the appropriate places.  Alot of times a simple drone in the tonic key will sound fine, perhaps chaning to a different chords the second time around.</p>\n<p>Celtic guitar arrangements can sound good with just two voices, the melody and a bass part.  The emphasis is on the melody, its different from travis picking where we have a bouncing bass part and syncopation going in. For now bass notes will be occurring on the beat, so a simple way to get the melody and bass is just with a pinch. One of your fingers plucks the melody on the higher string while your thumb gets the bass note on the lower string.</p>\n<p><strong>Tab/Notation Example</strong> &#8211; <strong><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/pinch.pdf\">Pinch.pdf</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Audio Example &#8211;<a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/pinch.mp3\"> MP3</a><br />\n</strong></p>\n<h3>Putting it all together</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll put it all together with a complete arrangement of the Kesh Jig, shown below.  I&#8217;ve based the bass line around the chords the tune oulines, G, C, and D.  In some places i substitute an E bass note, which represents an E minor chord i would play if i was strumming backup.  All the bass lines on are the beat, so we articulate the bass and melody notes with the pinch technique.  The carats above certain notes represent Middle Finger Thwacks, or MFT&#8217;s.  With this you are flicking the string with the back of your picking hand middle finger nail.  The finger curls into the palm, and then flicks out, striking the appropriate string.  I hope to do a full blog entry on that techniqe later.</p>\n<p>So we have tab/notation and audio samples for the arrangement.  The slow version is as close as the notation as i can get, the faster version probably contains some different stuff, as well as a few flubs.</p>\n<p><strong>Tab/Notation <a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/kesh.pdf\">Kesh Jig</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/keshslow.mp3\"><strong>Audio Sample Slow</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/keshfast.mp3\">Audio Sample Faster</a><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.  Feel free to get in touch with feedback or comments</p>\n<h3>Next Week</h3>\n<p>A full arrangement of O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s Reciept</p>\n",

One of your fingers plucks the melody on the higher string while your thumb gets the bass note on the lower string.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tab/Notation Example</strong> - <strong><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/pinch.pdf\">Pinch.pdf</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Audio Example -<a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/pinch.mp3\"> MP3</a>\r\n</strong>\r\n<h3>Putting it all together</h3>\r\nWe'll put it all together with a complete arrangement of the Kesh Jig, shown below.  I've based the bass line around the chords the tune oulines, G, C, and D.  In some places i substitute an E bass note, which represents an E minor chord i would play if i was strumming backup.  All the bass lines on are the beat, so we articulate the bass and melody notes with the pinch technique.  The carats above certain notes represent Middle Finger Thwacks, or MFT's.  With this you are flicking the string with the back of your picking hand middle finger nail.  The finger curls into the palm, and then flicks out, striking the appropriate string.  I hope to do a full blog entry on that techniqe later.\r\n\r\nSo we have tab/notation and audio samples for the arrangement.  The slow version is as close as the notation as i can get, the faster version probably contains some different stuff, as well as a few flubs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tab/Notation <a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/kesh.pdf\">Kesh Jig</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/keshslow.mp3\"><strong>Audio Sample Slow</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/keshfast.mp3\">Audio Sample Faster</a>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it.  Feel free to get in touch with feedback or comments\r\n<h3>Next Week</h3>\r\nA full arrangement of O'Carolan's Reciept",

          "I'd like to get started showing people the nuts and bolts of arranging celtic/traditional tunes. I found it very satisfying when i started arranging pieces for myself. Playing other folks arrangements is fun, but eventually i wanted to put my own stamp on things, or arrange tunes no one else had done before.\r\n\r\nIn this blog entry we will look at arranging the standard the Kesh Jig, for guitar.\r\n\r\nArranging celtic music can be a bit tricky at first, especially for those used to playing traditional american styles on the guitar. The alternating thumb/travis picking technique doesn't impart the right rhythm, and is not practical on the faster tunes. A different approach is neccessary to make the melodies flow like they would on the traditional instruments. A useful thing to remember is that these melodies are usually played on instruments like the fiddle, pipes, flute, and tin whistle. On these its easy to play to legato, not having to pick or articulate every note. Picking up a guitar and picking every single note can often times sound staccato and choppy. One of things we will look at is various ways to smooth out the melody.\r\n\r\nThere are some basic steps that i run through when arranging a tune. They are:\r\n\r\n1. Learn the melody till you have it cold, this can be with pick, fingers, whatever\r\n\r\n2. Learn to play the melody in several different places on the neck\r\n\r\n3. Start to incorporate bass line/harmony\r\n\r\n4. Practice it\r\n<h3>Learn the Melody</h3>\r\nI prefer to learn tunes by ear, played on traditional instruments if possible.  I feel for traditional music learning by ear is the way to go.  It may be tough in the beginning, but once you spend some time you will learn tunes qucker and retain them easier.  A lot of celtic tunes move at a brisk pace, so its useful to use software to slow them down while retain the pitch.  The Amazing Slow Downer and Trasncribe are two popular choices.  Quicktime player for Mac and Windows Media Player for Windows are two free options that will also slow down audio files.\r\n\r\nLearn the melody till you can play it from memory.  Having a solid grasp of the melody will make it easier once we start exploring options for an arrangement.\r\n<h3>Melodic Choices</h3>\r\nOnce you can play the melody solid you'll want to start experiement with playing it all over the neck of the guitar.  This is the time to start using different strings for certain melody notes, which can change the texture, and to start to think about melodic vs linear playing.\r\n\r\nMelodic technique is playing consecutive melody notes on different strings.  This allows the notes to sustain more and prevents the melody form sounding choppy.  Linear playing is voicing conecutive notes on the same string. Check out the two passages from O'Carolans Recipet and The Kesh Jig, which we will be learning in this article\r\n\r\n<strong>Tab Notation Examples</strong> -<strong><a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/melodiclinear.pdf\">Linear vs Melodic</a><a href=\"http://celticfingerstyleguitar.squarespace.com/storage/blog-content/melodiclinear.pdf\">\r\n</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Audio Clip</strong><strong> - <a href=\"http://www.celticfingerstyleguitar.com/wordpress/assets/linearmelodic.mp3\">Linear/Melodic</a></strong><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nOne technique is not neccessarily better than the other, they are just both options to consider.  One thing i like to do when looking for melodic options is to voice a note higher up on the neck instead of on the first or second string.  For example in Orkney tuning a G on the first string fifth fret sounds alot differnt than a G on third string twelfth fret.  If you really want a nice thick tone or make a certain note cry this is a good technique to consider.\r\n<h3>Bass and Harmony</h3>\r\nNext we want to start filling out the melody by starting to add a bass line.  Celtic music is not very complex harmonically. Tunes are usually in one of a few basic keys, and tend to stay there for the entire time. Basic diatonic chords for harmony work great. The main challenge (or at least one of them) with celtic fingerstyle guitar is finding a way to play the melody so it flows well, and be able to add in interesting bass and harmony.\r\n\r\nOnce you can play a melody cleanly from memory its time to start thinking about a bass line.  If you learned a tune from a recording you could just play along with it strumming chords to see what fits.  Some of you may be good enough to hear in your head where the harmony should go.  Once you figure out the basic chords work out a bassline that represents those chords.  So for a simple tune like the Kesh Jig whose chords are based around G, C, and D, my bass line might just be G, C, and D notes in the appropriate places.  Alot of times a simple drone in the tonic key will sound fine, perhaps chaning to a different chords the second time around.\r\n\r\nCeltic guitar arrangements can sound good with just two voices, the melody and a bass part.  The emphasis is on the melody, its different from travis picking where we have a bouncing bass part and syncopation going in.

As far as support that really helps, as I am putting proceeds from album sales towards the next cd. Other than that you can spread the word about my music to friends and fellow musicians who you think might enjoy it. I am just an independent musician, and by far the biggest challenge is spreading the word and getting my music out there. </p>\n<p>Glad you are enjoying the blog, and please don&#39;t hesitate to get in touch if you have some specific celtic guitar questions.</p>\n<p>thanks</p>\n<p>Anton</p>\n"

          "I'd like to start this out by posting some of the common chords i use for backing up celtic music in the Orkney Tuning.  I created these using <a href=\"http://www.frettycharts.com/index.htm\">Fretty Charts</a>.  I'll be getting the full version soon, so pardon the light demo version watermark on the fretboard.\r\n\r\nWithout a capo Orkney tuning is CGDGCD, low to high strings.  The 6th, 5th, and 1st strings are dropped down a step, and the 2nd string is raised up a step.  As long as you dont have anything heavier than medium gauge string on your guitar you should be fine raising that second string.\r\n\r\nIn Orkney i usually play backup with the Capo at the 2nd fret.

              "rendered": "<p>Thanks for the comment Kenneth.  I don&#8217;t have a specific guitar for Orkney, i have found most of my guitars work fine. The scale length on my guitar is 25 3/8&#8243;. I use medium gauge strings as well.  Sometimes I tune to standard, or I might get some heavier basses like you mentioned. I find at times the low C on the 6th string can get a bit floppy.  If you were going to have a guitar only for Orkney and never really tune it up a customized set might work fine.  I think John Doyle uses heavier bass strings for some of his various tunings. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it would be a waste of time, maybe just order a few customized sets and see how it feels. If I had more acoustics I might do the same thing, but I only have two I regularly play, so I like to keep them pretty flexible. Let me know how it goes!</p>\n"

              "rendered": "<p>Hi Anton. I was turned on to Orkney tuning by listening to Stephen Wake. This is becoming my new standard tuning. Do you have a guitar setup to use specifically for this tuning? I play a Huss and Dalton tom-r 25.5&#8243; scale. I used medium gauge phosphor bronze strings. I am considering buying customized string sets with heavier string gauges on the 1st, 5th, and 6th strings to compensate for the reduced string tension, thinking that this might improve the feel and intonation. Am I off base by thinking this way? Is it worth the trouble? Is it chasing the elusive ultimate guitar setup rabbit? What are your thoughts on this? Thank you. Ken Carr</p>\n"
